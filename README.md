# Citi Bike Analytics

This Dashboard visualizes data from the New York Citi Bike Program. Studied and analyzed daily reports of bike trips during winter months from 2015 to 2016. The purpose of this project is to provide helpful suggestions for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.

The Citi Bike Dashboard is hosted on the following tableau public account.

### Data Exploration

In this exploration, the months December, January, and February are considered winter months. Bike logs during the 2015-2016 winter are selected from the City Bike Trip History and aggregated into a new dataset with an inner join. 

### Discoveries
During these winter months, the most popular times to ride a bike are during the mornings and evenings.The peak hours are  8 - 9 AM and 5 - 6 PM because  people are commuting to work or class and then returning home in the evening around those time frames . 

The cluster of small circles at the bottom of the map indicates that riders take shorter trips to stations that are not as popular. This might have occurred because less popular stations are located in the suburbs. It makes sense that there is an over-abundance of bike stations in the metro area, as the population density is higher there.

Some consistently popular stations to start and end a trip are Pershing Square  North, W 21 St & 6 Ave, Lafayette St & E 8 St, E 17 St & Broadway, and Broadway & E 14 St. This may suggest that the demand for bike supplies for these areas are higher than other stations. Not only will adding more bikes allows more user accesibility, it will also reduce the repair fees on heavily bikes.
