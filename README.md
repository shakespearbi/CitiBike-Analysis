# Citi Bike Analytics

This Dashboard visualizes data from the New York Citi Bike Program. Studied and analyzed daily reports of bike trips during winter months from 2015 to 2016. The purpose of this project is to provide helpful suggestions for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.

The Citi Bike Dashboard is hosted on the following tableau public account.

### Data Exploration

In this exploration, the months December, January, and February are considered winter months. Bike logs during the 2015-2016 winter are selected from the City Bike Trip History and aggregated into a new dataset with an inner join. 

### Station Popularity
A station's popularity is based on the number of trips recorded at each station. The size of each circle on the map reflects the duration of a trip at a start or end station (i.e The bigger the circle, the longer the trip). The cluster of small circles at the bottom of the map indicates that riders take shorter trips to stations that are not as popular. This might have occurred because less popular stations are located in the suburbs. It makes sense that there is an over-abundance of bike stations in the metro area, as the population density is higher there.
